# Ridera Roadmap — 2025  
### Foundation, Architecture, Early Validation Phase  
### Ridera Protocol (Global Mobility RWA on Base)

---

# 1. Overview

2025 focuses on building the foundational infrastructure required for a global mobility RWA protocol.  
This includes the full architecture, Oracle v1, Fleet Portal alpha, internal earnings simulation system, and controlled early testing with real riders and fleets.

The goal:  
Establish a fully functional Alpha/Beta protocol by the end of Q4 2025.

# 2. Q4 2025 — Core Protocol Foundations

## 2.1 Ridera Protocol Architecture (v1.0)
- Completion of all protocol architecture documents  
- Core system design for revenue → SRU → yield cycle  
- Global Fleet Revenue Proof (G-FRP) framework  
- Standardization rules for multi-platform earnings  
- Model for regional weighting and global aggregation  

## 2.2 Ridera Oracle (v1)
- Semi-automated Oracle capable of:  
  - OCR parsing  
  - timestamp validation  
  - region-consistency checks  
  - multi-platform parsing rules  
- Fraud detection rule engine (v1)  
- Reputation scoring model draft  

## 2.3 Fleet Portal Alpha (v1)
- Basic interface for uploading:  
  - earnings screenshots  
  - statements  
  - rider IDs  
  - route metadata  
- Multi-language OCR support  
- Basic fleet grouping system  

## 2.4 Earnings Simulation Engine
- Internal simulation of daily revenue cycles  
- SRU conversion testing  
- Yield Vault mock deployment  
- Validator simulation layer  

## 2.5 Beta Fleet Onboarding (Closed Group)
- 20–50 real riders from multiple countries  
- Multi-region fleet testing  
- Live validation of earnings data  
- Integration with the Oracle  
- Daily cycle testing  

## 2.6 Validator Program (Internal)
- Selection of early validator group  
- Internal validation tools  
- Accuracy testing  
- Reputation scoring trial runs  

## 2.7 Documentation & Public Preparation
- Litepaper v5.0 release  
- Token model draft  
- Architecture files  
- GitHub repository structuring  
- Early brand identity  
- Early website structure

# 3. End-of-Year 2025 Milestones

By the end of 2025, Ridera will have:
- Completed protocol foundation  
- Released Oracle v1  
- Completed Fleet Portal Alpha  
- Completed earnings simulation engine  
- Validated multiple regions via closed beta  
- Published full documentation  
- Prepared for Q1 2026 testnet  

---

# 4. Goal for 2025

Create a stable, validated, well-tested foundation for the Ridera Testnet launch in Q1 2026, ensuring the protocol can support global scaling.
