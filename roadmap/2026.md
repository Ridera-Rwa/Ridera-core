# Ridera Roadmap — 2026  
### Testnet → Mainnet → Global Scaling  
### Ridera Protocol (Global Mobility RWA on Base)

---

# 1. Overview

2026 represents the first major public phase of the Ridera protocol.  
Starting with testnet deployment on Base, Ridera transitions to a global, live, revenue-verified RWA system.

The year is divided into two key phases:
- Q1 2026 — Public Testnet + Mainnet Launch  
- Q2 2026 — Global Scaling + Oracle Automation v2

# 5. End-of-Year 2026 Goals

By the end of Q2 2026, Ridera aims to:

- Fully operationalize mainnet  
- Validate global mobility income autonomously  
- Run automated Oracle v2  
- Onboard 10–15 new regions  
- Expand fleet participation  
- Strengthen validator governance  
- Release advanced analytics models
