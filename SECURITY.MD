# 🔐 Ridera Protocol – Security Policy

The Ridera Protocol team takes security very seriously.  
We are building a rewards and staking system where user trust and safety are top priority.  

This document explains how to report vulnerabilities, how we handle them, and 
our expectations for all security researchers.
