# Ridera Protocol

Ridera is a Real-World Work (RWW) tokenization protocol that converts verified gig-worker earnings into standardized on-chain productivity units (SRU).  
It transforms global mobility and delivery work into a verifiable, transparent, and programmable financial layer built on Base.

Ridera is not a ride-hailing app.  
It is the infrastructure layer that standardizes and verifies real-world work, enabling decentralized worker identity and sustainable reward systems.

## 🧠 About Ridera

Ridera introduces a new category within RWA called **Real-World Work (RWW)** — tokenizing human productivity instead of physical assets.  
Every worker who submits earnings data contributes to verifiable economic output represented as SRU.

This creates a global on-chain work identity system and unlocks future financial possibilities such as:

- Work-backed credit models  
- Insurance products  
- Platform incentives  
- DeFi integrations  
- Workforce analytics
