# 6. Ridera Standardization (G-FRP → SRU)

Ridera transforms fleet revenue into:
- G-FRP (verified proofs)  
- SRU (standardized revenue units)

The process:
1. Earnings submitted  
2. Platform consistency checks  
3. Oracle verification  
4. Standardized into SRU  
5. Added to global yield pool  

This creates the world’s first **universal mobility income index.**
