# **Ridera Tokenomics**
### The Economic Engine Behind Real-World Work (RWW)

---

# **1. Introduction**

Ridera introduces a sustainable, real-world-backed token economy where emissions, rewards, and ecosystem growth are directly tied to verified human productivity.  
The native token, **RDR**, powers staking, governance, incentives, and future ecosystem expansion.

Ridera does **not** inflate arbitrarily.  
All rewards are linked to verified SRU (Standardized Revenue Units) generated by global mobility activity.

# **2. Core Token Properties**

| Property | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Token Name** | Ridera Token |
| **Symbol** | RDR |
| **Total Supply** | 1,300,000,000 RDR (fixed) |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Network** | Base (L2) |

RDR is designed to be a **utility + governance + yield** asset supporting Ridera’s Real-World Work (RWW) infrastructure.

# **3. Economic Principles**

Ridera Tokenomics is built on three pillars:

## **3.1 Real-World Backing**
Emission depends on SRU → which depends on verified mobility income.

## **3.2 Sustainable Emissions**
Capped daily emission to avoid inflation.

## **3.3 Fair, Transparent Allocation**
Vesting schedules prevent dumping and ensure long-term participants remain aligned.

# **4. Emission Engine Integration**

RDR enters circulation through:

- Staking rewards  
- Ecosystem incentives  
- Partner integrations  

The emission engine uses:

```
dailyEmission = min( BASE + (SRU × factor), MAX )
```

This ensures **real economic output → real yield**.

# **5. Token Lifecycle**

**Minted at genesis → Distributed as per allocation → Rewarded by SRU-backed emissions → Used across the ecosystem → Circulated back via staking + partners**

# **8. Conclusion**

Ridera creates a token model that is:

- economically grounded  
- globally scalable  
- resistant to inflation  
- aligned with real-world work  

RDRT is the backbone of the Ridera mobility RWA ecosystem, powering yield, governance, and long-term protocol growth.
