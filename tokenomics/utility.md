# **RDR Utility**
### The Functional Role of Ridera's Native Token

---

# **1. Overview**

RDR is the core utility token of the Ridera Protocol.  
It enables:

- staking  
- validator bonding  
- governance (future)  
- ecosystem incentives  
- partner integrations  
- yield distribution  

Every component of Ridera interacts with RDR.

---

# **2. Staking Utility**

Users stake RDR to:

- earn SRU-backed daily rewards  
- participate in economic growth of the protocol  
- signal long-term commitment  

Stakers receive proportional rewards from the Yield Vault.

---

# **3. Validator Utility**

Validators must bond RDR to:

- audit flagged Oracle proofs  
- join validator committees  
- resist malicious behavior  
- avoid slashing  

Higher stake → more validation weight.

---

# **4. Governance Utility** *(future)*

RDR holders will vote on:

- SRU formula updates  
- emission factor changes  
- yield model improvements  
- Oracle rules  
- validator onboarding  

Governance activates after mainnet maturity.

---

# **5. Ecosystem Utility**

RDR is used for:

- partner incentives  
- mobility app integrations  
- developer grants  
- community rewards  
- early adopter programs  

Ridera’s ecosystem growth relies on RDR as the primary incentive currency.

---

# **6. Work Verification Economy**

Future upgrades enable:

- SRU-to-RDR collateralized credit  
- worker reputation score access  
- fleet-level rewards  
- marketplace integrations  

RDR becomes the settlement currency for protocol-level interactions.

---

# **7. Long-Term Vision**

RDR evolves from a staking token → protocol currency → mobility economy asset used globally in the Real-World Work (RWW) ecosystem.
