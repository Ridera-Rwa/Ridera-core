# **4. Partnerships, Investors & Grants — 14% (182M RDR)**

This allocation covers:

- strategic investors  
- platform partnerships  
- developer & ecosystem grants  
- mobility platform integrations  
- marketing + co-branding partners  

### **4.1 Vesting**
- **6 months lock**
- **12 months linear unlock**

### **4.2 What Happens If Ridera FAILS to Raise Investors?**

If no investors are raised before launch:

✔ **Partnership/Investor supply is NOT unlocked**  
✔ It remains **reserved** under Partnerships & Grants  
✔ We do NOT move it to Team  
✔ We do NOT dump it into circulation  
✔ It stays for:  
  - future partners  
  - platform integrations  
  - onboarding fleets  
  - real investors at a later date  

### **Important:**  
Nothing is wasted.  
Nothing becomes “extra tokens.”  
Everything remains **locked** until a valid use-case arrives.

Ridera stays SAFE from unnecessary dilution.
